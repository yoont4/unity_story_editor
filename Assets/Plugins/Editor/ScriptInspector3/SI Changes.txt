Unity's legendary editor for C#, UnityScript, Boo, Shaders, and text, now transformed into an advanced C# IDE!!!


IMPORTANT NOTE to all OS X users with Unity 5 Personal or Professional and Unity 4 Pro:
You may want to extend Si3's functionality with @inventor2010's amazing free plugin posted here:
	http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/script-inspector-3.195218/page-13#post-2226154
or even better, the updated version posted here:

The plugin allows handling Cmd-S, Cmd-Z, and Shift-Cmd-Z in Unity on OS X for more natural shortcuts for Save, Undo, and Redo operations in Si3!
Thank you @inventor2010 for being awesome!!! :)
